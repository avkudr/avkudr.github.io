Hi and welcome to my website!

My core skills and experience are at the confluence of robotics and computer vision. Specifically, I have developed algorithms for automatic navigation of a small continuum robot inside a nasal cavity, using incoming images; developed new 3D reconstruction techniques to obtain 3D models for microsamples using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and worked on a series of other tasks related to visual tracking and visual servoing for different complex systems and microassembly tools.

In 2017, I graduated from the [University of Franche-Comté](https://avkudr.github.io/www.univ-fcomte.fr/) with a PhD degree. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at [FEMTO-ST / AS2M](https://www.femto-st.fr/en/Research-departments/AS2M/Presentation) in Besançon, France. You can review my complete [CV-resume here](https://avkudr.github.io/assets/CV_Andrey_Kudryavtsev_web.pdf).

To learn more about my hands-on work, check out [my portfolio](/portfolio) and some of [my open-source projects](/projects).
